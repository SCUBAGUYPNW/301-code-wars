# Nice Array

Problem Domain: 
Evaluate if a given Array is "nice".
A nice array is an array that has values with other values equal to + || - 1 of the first value. IE array[8, 10, 7, 9] is "Nice" because 7 is + || - 1 of 8 and 9 is + || - 1 of 10. However array2[8, 10, 7, 9, 4] is not "nice" because there is no other value to be + || - 1 of 4.
