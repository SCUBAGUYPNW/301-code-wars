[Link to codewars problem](https://www.codewars.com/kata/disemvowel-trolls/train/javascript).

Problem Domain:
To fight off Trolls in the comments section, we want to take all their comments and remove the vowels from all the text. 

We will need to write a function that takes in a string and removes all the vowels from that string, and then returns the new string minus all the vowels.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y is not considered a vowel.
